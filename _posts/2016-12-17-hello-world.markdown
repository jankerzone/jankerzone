Unlike user and organization Pages, Project Pages are kept in the same repository as the project they are for, except that the website content is stored in a specially named gh-pages branch or in a docs folder on the master branch. The content will be rendered using Jekyll, and the output will become available under a subpath of your user pages subdomain, such as username.github.io/project (unless a custom domain is specified).

The Jekyll project repository itself is a perfect example: the master branch contains the actual software project for Jekyll, however the Jekyll website (that you’re looking at right now) is contained in the docs folder of the same repository.

User and organization pages live in a special GitHub repository dedicated to only the GitHub Pages files. This repository must be named after the account name. For example, @mojombo’s user page repository has the name mojombo.github.io.

Content from the master branch of your repository will be used to build and publish the GitHub Pages site, so make sure your Jekyll site is stored there.
